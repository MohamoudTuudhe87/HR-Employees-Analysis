# Project Overview
# Title: HR-Employee Data Analysis and Visualization

## Purpose
To analyze and visualize employee data to uncover insights related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and other factors that can influence organizational decisions.

## Description
This project involves cleaning and transforming a dataset containing employee information, followed by a series of visualizations to explore relationships and patterns within the data. The goal is to provide actionable insights into various aspects of employee attributes and behaviors.

## Objectives
